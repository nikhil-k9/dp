        1. Cloud services</br>
Cloud services provide many ways for business team members to interact with the technology they need. The cloud is an internet-connected platform that can store and access information and programs. Since the cloud stores the information instead of holding it on a computer, team members can access and use it whether at home or in the office. Some cloud services can even run operation systems remotely, allowing team members to use internal business programs remotely without installing them on their computers.
</p>
<p>2. Voice over internet protocol (VoIP)</br>
Voice over internet protocol is a communication tool for businesses. VoIP allows team members to make calls and send messages through their internet connections instead of through a phone line. This helps with internal long-distance communication for businesses that may have offices in different locations. Most VoIP services require paid subscriptions, which businesses can use with traditional phone services or as an alternative.

3. Backup solutions</br>
Backup solutions protect information loss from occurring by storing copies of data on external hardware or online platforms, such as a cloud service. Information backup services can help protect your business' information should any issues occur, like a power outage or system failure. Many information backup services exist, such as file backup, server backup and even desktop backup. Businesses can schedule automatic backups for their files to save the most recent versions of the files they create to ensure data is secure.

<p>4. Network security</br>

5. Monitoring</br>
IT services can monitor your network, internet traffic, computers and other internet-enabled devices.

Essentially, this IT service ensures that your team members have the tools and resources they need to complete their tasks.

6. Email services</br>
Businesses and organizations rely on email for many communication purposes. From individual messages and company-wide updates to customer relations, email is an important part of maintaining business relationships. IT teams may often oversee their businesses' email accounts and make recommendations on providers that suit their organizations' communication needs. IT email services can also be beneficial in sales and marketing processes, where IT teams work with sales and marketing professionals in keeping open communication with customers and sales leads.

7. Information reporting</br>
Through their data collection and monitoring, IT services can provide reports on information about your organization. They can create reports on topics such as the use of technology and information storage to help you understand how effective your company's current services are. Many organizations' IT services provide software that helps streamline financial and project reporting. Information reporting services may also arrange information in a way that helps you better understand your business and make important decisions.

8. Remote support</br>
Many IT services can provide technical support remotely. For instance, if one of your devices experiences an issue, IT services can access it through the internet to troubleshoot and repair it. Remote support allows them to find and repair issues more quickly and can apply to multiple devices, including most mobile devices. Having IT services with remote support capabilities can reduce the time to update applications and repair technical errors so your work can continue with minimal interruption.

9. Software as a service</br>
Software as a service (SaaS) refers to software programs that require a paid subscription. This can include word processing or database software. IT services can connect you with the services you need and monitor the connection to help you make sure you can use it when you need it. Using software as a service sometimes includes cloud access, so your team can work remotely on their own devices should they need to. With most SaaS subscriptions, businesses receive additional IT service features, including technical support for the software.

11. Troubleshooting and technical support</br>
IT services for many organizations also include technical support and troubleshooting for software applications, programs and online tools.

With a dedicated technical support service, your organization can receive the technical assistance it needs when staff members have questions or challenges when using company software.

In these cases, an IT team can train staff in your company on how to use specific tools, programs and applications.
